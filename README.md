# Microstrip Patch Antenna, Microstrip Low Pass Filter and Microstrip Power Divider

designed and fabricated a linearly polarised rectangular/square microstrip patch antenna on a given FR-4 epoxy substrate of thickness 1.6 mm and dielectric constant 4.4 at a frequency of 2.4 GHz.
Micro strip antennas are low-profile antennas. A metal patch mounted at a ground level with a di-electric material in-between constitutes a Micro strip or Patch Antenna. These are very low size antennas having low radiation. The radiation pattern of microstrip or patch antenna is broad. It has low radiation power and narrow frequency bandwidth. Microstrip antennas find many applications as they are light weight, conformable to surface and inexpensive to manufacture using printed-circuit technology. Microstrip patch antennas are becoming increasingly useful because they can be printed directly onto a circuit board.
RETURN LOSS: The return loss represents how much feeding power that was reflected back at the port of patch antenna as a result of the mismatches between the transmission line and the feeding points. When the antenna and transmission line are not perfectly matched, reflections at the antenna port travel back towards the source and cause a standing wave to form. Good antenna must have high return loss.
VSWR: VSWR shows how much power is reflected back from the antenna towards the source. The good value that accepted for antenna is 1 VSWR 2. If the VSWR value equals 1, means all of the given power to the antenna is transmitted.
RADIATION PATTERN: The energy radiated by antenna is represented by radiation pattern of the antenna. There are a few types of radiation pattern such as 3D radiation pattern, 2D radiation pattern and Lobe formation radiation pattern.
GAIN: The gain of an antenna is defined as the ratio of intensity in a given direction to the radiation intensity that is obtained if the power accepted by the antenna is radiated in an isotropic manner. An antenna is not a lossless system, and some energy entering the antenna terminals is lost due to heat losses etc. The gain of an antenna describes the rates of power transmitted to peak radiation through isotropic source.
Construction & Working of Micro strip Antennas: Micro strip antenna consists of a very thin metallic strip placed on a ground plane with a di-electric material in-between. The radiating element and feed lines are placed by the process of photo-etching on the di-electric material. Usually, the patch or micro-strip is choosen to be square, circular or rectangular in shape for the ease of analysis and fabrication.
For a rectangular patch, the length L of the element is usually L <λg/2 (where λg is the guided wavelength in the substrate). Thicker substrates with lower dielectric constant provide better efficiency and larger bandwidth but at the expense of larger element size. Thin substrates with higher dielectric constants lead to smaller element sizes, minimize coupling, but are less efficient and have relatively smaller bandwidths. Here we taking the length of the metal patch is λ/2. When the antenna is excited, the waves generated within the di-electric undergo reflections and the energy is radiated from the edges of the metal patch, which is very low.
